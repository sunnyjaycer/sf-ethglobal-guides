## **Creating Your First Stream with the SDK Core**

Creating streams with the SDK core is dead simple - you just need to pass in the `receiver`, `superToken`, and `flowRate`.

- Note: you may also pass in an optional bytes value called `userData`, but that’s advanced class stuff. [Read more about it in our docs.](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/developer-guides/super-apps/user-data)

First, let's import the SDK and initialize it using the `Framework` object, and make sure that we have a signer ready to go for sending transactions. Note that this pattern will work whether your signer comes from a browswer wallet or via a private key or local environment.


```
const { Framework } = require("@superfluid.finance/sdk-core");
const signers = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
const provider = new hre.ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.GOERLI_URL);

const sf = await Framework.create({
  chainId: (await provider.getNetwork()).chainId,
  provider
});
```
From here, we can create a money streaming operation that we will send and sign from our signer:
```
const createFlowOperation = sf.cfaV1.createFlow({
  receiver: “0x123…”,
  superToken: daix.address,
  flowRate: “385802469135802” //equivalent to 1000 dai per month
});

//note - we're sending this transaction from signer #1 in the array we get back from ethers.getSigners()
await createFlowOperation.exec(signers[0]);
```

Note that you can see a stream created in a react application in [this section of our docs](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/interactive-tutorials/money-streaming-1). You should go there for interactive examples you can plug into your front end!
